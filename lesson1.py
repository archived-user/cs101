# Write a Python program that prints out the number of minutes in seven weeks.
# Remember: 7 weeks 7 days in a week, 24 hours in a day, and 60 mins in an hour.
# Multiplying these numbers together will give you the result

# Write Python code to print out how far light travels 
# in centimeters in one nanosecond.  Use the values
# defined below.    
# speed_of_light = 299792458   meters per second
# centimeters = 100            one meter is 100 centimeters
# nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000  one billionth of a second

# out the number of days you have been alive.

# of the first URL that appears in a link 
# tag in the string page.
# Your code should print http://udacity.com
# Make sure that if page were changed to
# page = '<a href="http://udacity.com">Hello world</a>'
# that your code still assigns the same value to the variable 'url', 
# and therefore still prints the same thing.
