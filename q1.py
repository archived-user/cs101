# Write a Python program that prints out the number of minutes in seven weeks.
# Remember: 7 weeks 7 days in a week, 24 hours in a day, and 60 mins in an hour.
# Multiplying these numbers together will give you the result

# Write Python code to print out how far light travels 
# in centimeters in one nanosecond.  Use the values
# defined below.    
# speed_of_light = 299792458   meters per second
# centimeters = 100            one meter is 100 centimeters
# nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000  one billionth of a second
print 299792458 * 100 * (1.0/1000000000)

# Given the variables defined here, write Python 
# code that prints out the distance, in meters, 
# that light travels in one processor cycle. 
# speed_of_light in meters per second
# cycles_per_second is 2.7 GHz
speed_of_light = 299792458.0

# Write python code that defines the variable 
# age to be your age in years, and then prints 
# out the number of days you have been alive.
