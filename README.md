My own notes from CS101 course in Udacity.

Programs are instructions for machines to perform computation.
Python programs are interpreted by yet another program (the Python interpreter) to get the computer to do stuff.
Programming languages eliminates ambiguity and verbosity (using more words than necessary) to get instructions across.
Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a formal notation to describe the syntax of a given language.

Procedures package codes so that they can be repeatedly used.
A procedure may take in some inputs and provide corresponding outputs.
With procedures there is a need for controls.
