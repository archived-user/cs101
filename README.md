My own notes from CS101 course in Udacity.

Programs are instructions for machines to perform computation.
Python programs are interpreted by yet another program (the Python interpreter) to get the computer to do stuff.
Programming languages eliminates ambiguity and verbosity (using more words than necessary) to get instructions across.
Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a formal notation to describe the syntax of a given language.
