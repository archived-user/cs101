# Write Python code that prints out the number of hours in 7 weeks.
print 24 * 7 * 7

# Write Python code that stores the distance 
# in meters that light travels in one 
# nanosecond in the variable, nanodistance. 
# These variables are defined for you:
speed_of_light = 299800000. # meters per second
nano_per_sec = 1000000000. # 1 billion
# After your code, running the following:
# print nanodistance
# should output: 0.2998
# Note that nanodistance must be a decimal number.
# ASSIGN nanodistance BELOW this line
nanodistance = speed_of_light / nano_per_sec
print nanodistance

# Given the variables s and t defined as:
s = 'udacity'
t = 'bodacious'
# write Python code that prints out udacious
# without using any quote characters in
# your code.
print s[:2] + t[3:]

# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the first occurrence of 'hoo'
# in the value of text, or -1 if
# it does not occur at all.
text = "first hoo" 
# ENTER CODE BELOW HERE
print text.find('hoo')

# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the second occurrence of 'zip'
# in text, or -1 if it does not occur
# at least twice.
# The Python code should be general enough
# to pass every possible case where 'zip' 
# can occur in a string
# Here are two example test cases:
#text = 'all zip files are zipped' 
# >>> 18
#text = 'all zip files are compressed'
# >>> -1
text = "all zip files are zipped" 
# ENTER CODE BELOW HERE
first_zip = text.find('zip')
second_zip = text.find('zip',first_zip + 1)
print second_zip
# IMPORTANT BEFORE SUBMITTING: 
# You should only have one print command in your function

# Given a variable, x, that stores the 
# value of any decimal number, write Python 
# code that prints out the nearest whole 
# number to x.
# If x is exactly half way between two 
# whole numbers, round up, so
# 3.5 rounds to 4 and 2.5 rounds to 3.
# You may assume x is not negative.
# Hint: The str function can convert any number into a string.
# eg str(89) converts the number 89 to the string '89'
# Along with the str function, this problem can be solved 
# using just the information introduced in unit 1.
# x = 3.14159 
# >>> 3 (not 3.0)
# x = 27.63 
# >>> 28 (not 28.0)
# x = 3.5 
# >>> 4 (not 4.0)
x = 3.14159
#ENTER CODE BELOW HERE
s = str(x+0.5)
dot = s.find('.')
print s[:dot]
